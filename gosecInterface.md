## Team: Madeline Phillips, Senjuti Dutta

Golang has become more prevalent in large codebases recently. Larger codebases make vulnerabilities more difficult to find, so the Secure Go project has created the static analysis tool ["gosec"](https://github.com/securego/gosec) to help developers find vulnerabilities in their codebases. However, gosec is a purely command-line tool with many options and minimal documentation, making it less-than-friendly for first-time users. Since developers are much more likely to use security tools if they're simple and easy, our project is to build an interface for gosec that will make installation and interaction direct and self-explanatory. This interface will simplify the security aspect of developing software in Golang. We still need a third team member, so please reach out to Madeline Phillips (mphill66@vols.utk.edu) if you're interested.
