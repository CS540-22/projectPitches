# Graphical Lines of Code (GLOC)
### Members: Ben Greenberg, Spencer Howell, Daniel Troutman

Our proposal is to create a GUI for the command line tool Count Lines of Code (CLOC) which can be found at https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc.

This tool allows developers to quickly get an overview of the state of their project, including the number of lines of code, languages used, and the number of comments and blank lines. This information is useful to inform developers on technical debt, cleanup efforts, and total program size.

However, the current CLOC tool is limited to local use only, and all output is in text on the command line. We would like to make the tool more easily available and useful by providing a web interface. Users insert a URL of a Github repository, and the server will return a graphical representation of the results of the CLOC tool. This could include interactive graphs and charts, and the ability to export the results for use in presentations and reports.

Our team believes that this project can make the CLOC utility more easily utilized by a variety of developers.
