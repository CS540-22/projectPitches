Extended GUI for Terminal/Command Line

This gui will allow users to quickly select/search from a variety
of well-known commands and subsequently execute them in the terminal.

The aim of this tool is to alleviate the stress of recalling previously
used commands and having to type them out by creating a more visual
and interactive terminal experience.

Take, for example, compiling C++ code. Simpler compilation commands are
easy to remember, but ultimately there are a multitude of flags that can
change the compilation result and it can be hard to recall them
whenever a particular set of flags may be needed.

This interface will have categories of possible commands to execute
as well as sub-categories for things such as flags and other variables.
