Developing a plugin for Unity Engine to streamline VRChat word and avatar development - including features like GLSL to HLSL shader conversion, guides for using VRChatâ€™s custom Udon# programming language and built in animation systems, snippet searching and automation, as well as code conversion for Udon# coding.

Unity development and VRChat development in particular are large industries and provide awesome growth in a relatively unexplored area.

Access to VR devices is not required to develop for the platform.
Unity programming is done predominately in C# and JavaScript. If you have experience with these, this project will be incredibly straightforward.
Udon# is essentially a dialect of C#, used to sandbox VRChat worlds which run as essentially a multiplayer container for Unity games.
