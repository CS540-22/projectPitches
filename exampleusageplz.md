API documentation often will have examples for commonly used calls, or some but not others. Documentation sites are often generated from javadocs or otherwise, describing the function and parameters. Often times this is not enough context to answer the question, ‘is this appropriate for my specific use case.’ Collection of forks of documentation for popular APIs/frameworks organized into a website with relatively simple search functionality that returns usage examples across publicly available source code with a specific API call. Users can rate and submit example usage. A reach goal would enable easy integration of the sample usage by the original maintainers.
