Often times, an individual is required to provide an offical transcript from the university that conferred their degree onto them; this takes time (and often money)
for the university to locate the records and to then send them to the requesting entity. 

Blockchain technology is, at its core, an immutable public ledger; the proposed project would be a system in which student's official transcripts are first
encrypted with a secret key that is shared only with the entity that is to recieve the offical transcript. This encrypted transcript would then be signed using 
the university's private key before being appended to the blockchain. The university's public key would then be used the verify that the transcript is in fact
from that instiitution, but without the indivdual's consent (sharing the secret key), the contents of the transcript would be unreadable.

Truth be told, I have no experience with Blockchain technology, and just a high level understanding of encryption that would be required. This project may be outside
of what is doable within the time allocated, but I thought that it would be an interesting opportunity to explore non-crypto applications of Blockchain.
