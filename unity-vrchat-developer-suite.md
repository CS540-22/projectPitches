Developing a plugin for Unity Engine to streamline VRChat world and avatar development, and Unity development in general - including features like GLSL to HLSL shader conversion, guides for using VRChatâ€™s custom Udon# programming language and built in animation systems, snippet searching and automation, as well as code conversion for Udon# coding.

Even simply something sort of like a IntilliSense-esque code completion tool for VRChat's U# programming language would be a great goal.

We can determine specifically what features to implement as a team based on interest & time. Definitely open to adding other features to this project, so you can pursue whatever you find interesting along the way.

Unity development and VRChat development in particular are large industries and provide awesome growth in a relatively unexplored area.

Access to VR devices is not required to develop for the platform.
Unity programming is done predominately in C# and JavaScript. If you have experience with these, this project will be incredibly straightforward.
Udon# is essentially a dialect of C#, used to sandbox VRChat worlds which run as essentially a multiplayer container for Unity games.
