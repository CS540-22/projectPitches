A tool which suggests projects for developers to work on based on what they want to do.

Uses ML to suggest project based on resume, area of interest, specific technology, and/or desired company.
  - Easy: Can just be a large database with a decent front-end.
  - Medium: Above plus github crawler to populate project database and ML to suggest projects based on likes and dislikes?
  - Hard: Above plus resume analyzer feeding into ML along with desired company/technology to suggest projects.

Technologies:
  - database: I think this can just be mysql or any other relational thing.
  - database API: REST on Go
  - front-end: Bootstrap on top of ???
  - github crawler: Rust
  - ML: Probably Python
  - resume analyzer: Kotlin???

Features and technologies are not set in stone, just first thoughts.

Current team is Isaac Sikkema (me) and Phillip Hicks. Hoping for one more person.
