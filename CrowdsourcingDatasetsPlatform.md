My idea is website/platform that searches for open source datesets based on a description/requirements and also allows developers to
crowdsource data samples to create new datasets from scratch.

Machine learning and data science projects usually require lots of data and many times it is difficult to find/create a dataset
that matches what is needed.
My idea is a tool will allow developers to search for existing datasets based on a description or required features of the dataset that
they need.
The tool will return links to the most relevent datasets that it can find by crawling through kaggle/google/etc.
If no dataset exists yet that is sufficient for a project, the tool will also allow developers to post a detailed description of a
dataset that they need along with some examples of data points and other users can create and upload samples that fit the requirements
in order to help create that dataset from scratch (sort of like a gofundme but for data).

[Crowdsource by Google](https://crowdsource.google.com/about/) provides a very similiar functionality except Google provides all the
datasets and questions and only uses the crowdsourced data for its own products and does not share the data that is gathered.

Building blocks:
  - A frontend UI (probably a website)
  - A search engine/crawler to search for and return datasets relevent to a query
  - A database to store user profiles, crowdsourced datasets etc.

I (Alan Hencey) am very comfortable with Python and SQL but I am not very good with anything frontend or UI related.
