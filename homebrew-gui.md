# Homebrew Gui

## Team: Braxton Haynie, Colter Swanson, and Vishal Aiely

Homebrew is a free and open-sourced package manager that is commonly used by MacOS users and some Linux users. While homebrew is relatively easy to use and understand on its own, we thought that it could be made even simpler. Another feature we thought that could be useful is searching through possible packages to offer suggestions based on need. We plan on developing the gui using the Flutter SDK, so the desktop app could be portable for both Linux and MacOS. The end goal of the gui is to make a very simple and easy to use interface where you can download the packages you want with the push of a button.
